           Behind every success story lies a mentor. Most of us have heard of Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Marissa Mayer, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Hewlett and David Packard, but what we do not know is that all of them have had mentors who helped them achieve success.
Everyone wants to do something in life, but more often than not, one cannot achieve one’s dreams by oneself. Sometimes, one may even feel dejected by a lack of success and cease to believe in oneself. That is the problem that a good mentor tries to address: the great chasm between expectation and reality. 

<br><br>
People who want to achieve something must know three things:<br>
<ul>
    <li>What they are capable of doing.</li>
    <li>What exactly they want to do.</li>
    <li>How they plan to do it.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Most of who you are is assessed more by people than by you:</b> A good mentor always knows one’s mentee’s true capabilities. As for what you want to do and how you plan to do it, it all depends on you yourself. 
<br>
<br>
 <b>It is the hand that sculpts, and the sculpture that appeals:</b>Mentors facilitate discovery of the self and help you develop your own style of leadership. One cannot overcome self-doubt without a mentor.
<br><br>
<b>All mentors are masters of the art of listening: </b>Good mentors do only one thing 99% of the time: they listen. They listen to what you have to say about yourself, your ideas and how you want to change the world. The other 1% of the time, they help you re-align and achieve that goal.
Today, as members of SHEILD (CSED), it is very important that each and every one of us learns to mentor. As members of a club which deals exclusively with start-ups, people interested in start-ups and leadership development, it is imperative that all of us learn how to foster and nurture an enterprising mind. In Kick Startup, we, the members of this organization have the perfect opportunity to learn to be great mentors. Go out there, meet new people, learn from them, stay in touch with them, and guide them. In doing so, you will all have taken the first step to being great mentors.

⁠⁠Imagination is its own form of courage

We, as an organisation have substantially grown into something which we all believe in, and want to work for in the past month. We have had a successful merger with CSED which is a major step towards building our brand in the college.
We have had 4 wonderful Saturday sessions which were filled with very informative and beautiful topics followed by discussions. We look forward to the members showing more enthusiasm towards this initiative from here on.
We have attained great pace and there's a momentum set currently in our organisation which should not go down anytime soon.
Everyone's increasing commitment towards their work shows ownership growing in the organisation.
We have our flagship events coming up. People, it's that time of the year when we can get closer to our vision.
We all will be working in synergy to pull off both our amazing events this Gravitas.


Be the type of energy that no matter where you go, you add value to the spaces and lives around you.<br> <!-- <div style="color: white; text-align: right;">- Sahil, Vice-President Public Relations</div> -->

           <p class="add-bottom">
           People are considered to be extremely lucky if they can earn a living by doing something they love and are passionate about. Some of them are actors, musicians, artists, athletes or just regular people who stumbled onto a video sharing website, uploaded videos of themselves doing stuff they’re good at, went viral and ended up pocketing enough to live a comfortable life. Think: YouTube and YouTubers. But is it really that straightforward? Just making videos and getting a good number of views on them don’t get you any money. So how exactly do YouTubers earn money? <br><br>

YouTubers can earn money in three ways - advertisements, merchandise and through sponsored content.  <br><br>
Revenue from advertisements is the main source of income for most YouTubers. Due to the impact of social media, almost all companies have their ads doing rounds before and in-between videos on YouTube. In order to have ads in their videos, YouTubers must monetize their channels, that is, they must have an approved Google AdSense account linked to their channel. Monetization of accounts allows companies to place their ads in and around videos, making these ads visible to viewers accessing YouTube. For every thousand views on the ad, advertising companies offer a certain amount of money, of which 45% is taken by YouTube and the remaining 55% is pocketed by the owner of the channel. The ad rate is around $3 to $5 for every thousand views on the ad. <br><br>
But simply getting views on a video does not guarantee that the viewers watched the ad or clicked on it. What if they skipped the ad? Therefore, the ad rate is valid only when a viewer watches either half of the ad or thirty seconds of it, whichever is earlier. So say a video got one million views, but none of the viewers watched the ads in the video, then the YouTuber will earn nothing from that video. All in all, revenue depends on the activity of the viewers and hence channels with a large number of subscribers and viewers are likely to earn more money through advertisements as compared to smaller channels. In 2016, famous Swedish YouTuber PewDiePie made around $10 million from ad revenue. <br><br>

Several YouTubers have their own merchandise doing rounds in the markets. Logan Paul and Jake Paul, both popular YouTubers, have their own lines of hoodies, t-shirts, mugs, caps and other goodies that are bought by their huge fan followings. 
But, not all subscribers of a channel purchase merchandise. In fact, only about 0.005% to 3% of the average YouTuber’s audience goes ahead and buys merchandise. So to make merchandising cost effective, one must have an insanely large audience to sell to. For small or upcoming channels, merchandising is not feasible as a source of income, whereas for popular YouTubers, it can yield even more money than what they earn from advertisements. <br><br>

The third way for YouTubers to earn money is through sponsored content. YouTubers are paid by companies to make videos discussing various products and services offered by the companies. <br><br>
The amount that companies shell out for such paid product placements depends on the size of the YouTube channel, the demographic and view count. Big channels with north of a million subscribers are paid several thousands of dollars for a specific sponsorship as compared to lesser amounts for channels with fifty thousand to a hundred thousand subscribers. This contrast in pay is due to the significant difference in the number of views a video on a big channel and a small channel will garner.  <br><br>
Sponsored videos can be of many types – un-boxings, product reviews, or can be subtle mentions of products in videos. For example, Humorously Yours, a web series by TVF endorsed OnePlus devices all throughout the series. <br><br>
For a YouTuber with a huge and dedicated fan following, advertisements, merchandising and sponsored content can fetch them a lot of money. PewDiePie, who has the highest number of subscribers on YouTube with fifty seven million, is also the highest earning YouTuber as he pocketed $15 million in 2016. Roman Atwood and Lily Singh occupy the second and third positions with their earnings being $8 million and $7.5 million respectively. 
Being a YouTuber has it’s benefits, after all! <br><br>
